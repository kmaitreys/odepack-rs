# Solve systems of differential equations

Look inside tests for use cases.

Works on stiff ODEs.

# ODEPACK

I obtained the ODEPACK code that is present in this repository from [here](http://www.netlib.org/odepack/).
I do not know what the licensing of the original ODEPACK code is, I assume it is released to the public domain.
